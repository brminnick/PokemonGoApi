# PokemonGoApi
An API developed in C# with the premise to interact with Pokémon GO server.
 * Use at your own risk!
 * Secondary accounts should be used.

## Building
A C# Library Project must be created with the name "PokemonGoApi", after this you should run the following commands in the NuGet console.

   Install-Package Newtonsoft.Json  
   Install-Package Google.Protobuf -Pre  
   Install-Package Google.Protobuf.Tools -Pre
   
(Google.Protobuf.Tools is optional, use in the case that you want to modify .proto files)
After installing the references it's easy as add the .cs files to the project and compile it.

## What's done so far
 * Server query backend
 * Pokémon Club login
 * Handshake
 * Retrieve profile status

## Example

    using System;
    
    namespace PokemonGoTestApp
    {
        class Program
        {
            static void Main(string[] args)
            {
                PokemonGoApi.GoApi goApi = new PokemonGoApi.GoApi(PokemonGoApi.AuthenticationService.pokemonClubLogin("PTC_ID", "PTC_PW"));
                PokemonGoApi.Proto.ClientPlayerDetails clientPlayerDetails = goApi.getPlayerDetails();
                Console.WriteLine("[+] Username : {0}", clientPlayerDetails.Username);
                Console.WriteLine("[+] Poke Storage : {0}", clientPlayerDetails.PokeStorage);
                Console.WriteLine("[+] Item Storage : {0}", clientPlayerDetails.ItemStorage);
                Console.WriteLine("[+] Account creation time : {0}", clientPlayerDetails.CreationTime);
                Console.ReadKey();
            }
        }
    }
